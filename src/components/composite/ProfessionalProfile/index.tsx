        Hey! My name is Marcel Coelho, currently working as a senior software
        engineer at Appen through Novatics, where me and my team are responsible
        for upgrading a 10+ year old system written in Java into a faster and
        redesigned React version.

        I love working on complex problems with teams of talented people. I hate
        being the smartest guy in the room. I speak near native English, know a
        thing or two about design and love to drive fast cars. Iâ€™m a very driven
        and committed person and I love public speaking.
