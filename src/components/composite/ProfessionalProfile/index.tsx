        Hey! My name is Marcel Coelho, I'm a software engineer from Brazil, with
        5 years of experience with JavaScript, currently working with React and
        Typescript and looking for an opportunity to be part of a
        product/startup team.

        I love working on complex problems with teams of talented people. I hate
        being the smartest guy in the room. I speak near native English, know a
        thing or two about design and love to watch Rick and Morty. Iâ€™m a very
        driven and committed person and I love public speaking.
